%%X1 Future Work

The scheduling methodology can integrate the work presented in \cite{PredictionModel}
for higher accuracy in predicting the performance state required by a particular task. 
The fact that there exists a correlation between
IPC and speedup can be utilized to produce a more robust system. The first
steps would be to provide strong support within the Linux kernel for asymmetric
multiprocessors which will enable further study into the aspect of performance
directed scheduling.
