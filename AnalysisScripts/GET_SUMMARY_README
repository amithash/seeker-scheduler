1. go to log main dir. 
example
cd $THESIS/data/delta5_4_t7

2. Run analyzeDVFS.pl.

$THESIS/scripts/analyzeDVFS.pl --list --bench > $THESIS/data/summary/delta5_bench_t1

delta5_bench_t1 contains the bench results. 

3. Run j_i.pl on this file
cd $THESIS/data/summary
$THESIS/scripts/j_i.pl -i ./delta5_bench_t1 > ./jpbi_delta5_t1

NOTE - skip steps 3 and 4 if fixed results are already avaliable. 

3. Run analyzeDVFS on fixed results.
cd $THESIS/data/fixed_4_t5
$THESIS/scripts/analyzeDVFS.pl --list --bench > $THESIS/data/summary/fixed_bench_t1
cd $THESIS/data/fixed_4_t6
$THESIS/scripts/analyzeDVFS.pl --list --bench > $THESIS/data/summary/fixed_bench_t2
cd $THESIS/data/fixed_4_t7
$THESIS/scripts/analyzeDVFS.pl --list --bench > $THESIS/data/summary/fixed_bench_t3

4. Run j_i.pl on these files.
cd $THESIS/data/summary
$THESIS/scripts/j_i.pl -i ./fixed_bench_t1 > ./jpbi_fixed_t1
$THESIS/scripts/j_i.pl -i ./fixed_bench_t3 > ./jpbi_fixed_t2
$THESIS/scripts/j_i.pl -i ./fixed_bench_t3 > ./jpbi_fixed_t3

5. Repeat steps 1,2,3 for other trials. (Analize requires at least 3 trials.)

6. Run analize.r
cd $THESIS/data/summary
Rscript $THESIS/scripts/analize.r
