None of the README's and Documentation are currently 100% accurate. 
There is a lot of changes which are going on, and these documentation
will be added when the revamp is over. 

Currently, the following are the basic changes going on:

1. No Modules/c2d Modules/k8
2. <arch><mod> is now just <mod> and present in Module/ in their own directories
   and seperations are in codes with #if defined(ARCH_<arch>) -- 
   Removing duplicated code.
3. Added scpufreq an interface to cpufreq.
4. no Module/seeker-sampler-src.c This has split into a lot of pieces 
   into objs which do one thing (io, inter, probe etc). 
   Thus improving maintainability. 
5. generic_log_dump is now seekerd and no longer an app, but a daemon. 
   (When executed, it runs in the background) and it has changable defaults
   thus you can start it with Scripts/seekerd and a default of 1 sec and op 
   file format of /var/log/seeker is used.
6. Lots of work in ThesisModules.... Plz, let me graduate!
