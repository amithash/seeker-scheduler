Patches:
--------

Patches to get pmu interrupt feature:

seeker-kernel-2.6.18.5.patch -> Patch for the 2.6.18.x kernel
seeker-kernel-2.6.24.7.patch -> Patch for the 2.6.24.x kernel
seeker-kernel-2.6.25.18.patch-> Patch for the 2.6.25.x kernel and above

Patches modifying sched.h to do the scheduling:

< 2.6.18 is not supported.
schedmod-kernel-2.6.24.7.patch -> Patch for the 2.6.24.x kernel
schedmod-kernel-2.6.25.18.patch-> Patch for the 2.6.25.x kernel

Things have changed a lot between these kernels, and I'd go with 2.6.25 it is more roburst and mature. 2.6.24 got a lot of changes and 2.6.25 saw those things stabalizing. 

PATCHING THE KERNEL:
--------------------

Do the following to apply this patch:

cd /path/to/kernel/source
patch -p1 /path/to/seeker-kernel-2.6.x.y.patch
and then continue configuring, compiling and installing the new kernel.

SIDE NOTES:
-----------

Kernel versions vary a lot. The 2.6.18 is completely different from the 2.6.24.
And I'd really recommend using a 2.6.18 kernel for the 2.6.18 patch and the 
2.6.24 patch to the 2.6.24 kernel. And of course to use the 2.6.24 and greater kernels.

If you really want to use another kernel not mentioned here, here are some notes:
1. Use the 2.6.18 patch on anything less than 2.6.24 
2. Use the 2.6.24 for kernels greater than 2.6.24 -> This kernel has a lot of changes.
3. After applying the patch pay attention on the error messages or warnings if any.
4. Here is a list of files my patch modifies:
	2.6.18:
		x86:
		arch/i386/kernel/apic.c
		include/asm-i386/apic.h
		include/asm-i386/hw_irq.h
		include/asm-i386/irq.h
		include/asm-i386/mach-default/arch_entry.h
		x86_64:
		arch/x86_64/kernel/apic.c
		arch/x86_64/kernel/i8259.c
		arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S
		include/asm-x86_64/apic.h
		include/asm-x86_64/hw_irq.h
		include/asm-x86_64/irq.h
	>= 2.6.24:
		x86:
		arch/x86/kernel/apic_32.c
		include/asm-x86/apic_32.h
		include/asm-x86/hw_irq_32.h
		include/asm-x86/irq_32.h
		include/asm-x86/mach-default/arch_entry.h
		x86_64:
		arch/x86/kernel/apic_64.c
		arch/x86/kernel/i8259_64.c
		arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S
		include/asm-x86/apic_64.h
		include/asm-x86/hw_irq_64.h
		include/asm-x86/irq_64.h
5. If something cannot be done, check why. 
6. If you are feeling brave, here is some tip to know something is wrong.
	I do everything what the kernel does with the local timer. If you 
	see that and not *pmu_interrupt add/modify/delete it. 
	
7. If you do not want to do these things, send me an email with the kernel
   version number. I will send you a patch.
8. the schedmod patch is very *very* simple. All it does is add a few more variables to task_struct so I can keep track of each task without having my own list and lookups!
