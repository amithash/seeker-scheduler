% Thesis statement:
% =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
% With the advent of run-time systems into mainstream computing, it is
% imperative for us to comprehend and address the existing barriers to run-time
% systems so as to leverage their utmost potential 
%
% Run-time systems are yet to be realized in everyday computing environments due
% to existing barriers that researchers ought to comprehend and address so as to
% leverage their utmost potential. 
%
% Dynamic code transformation systems are yet to be realized in everyday
% computing environments due to the fundamental barrier of execution overhead.
% As such, it is imperative for researchers to comprehend and address this
% challenge so as to leverage their utmost potential.

% Draco
I would first like to thank the members of the DRACO research group for their
insight and ideas. Particularly, I would like to thank David Ellis who
contributed to this work with his ideas, analysis, coding and debugging. I would not have
been able to finish without him.

% Friends
I would like to thank my friends who have provided me with needed distractions
throughout my academic career. Having outlets other than work and research has
enabled me to enjoy life while succeeding as an engineer.

% Dan
My advisor, Professor Dan Connors has guided me through my research. I would
like to thank him for his knowledge and encouragement throughout my time at CU. His immediate and
honest feedback has made this work possible.

% Family
Most importantly, I would like to thank my family. My parents, Dennis and Betty
Jo, have supported me throughout out my life and have provided me with
opportunities to succeed. My sister Jenni has always been there with friendship
and assistance. I would also like to acknowledge my brother-in-law Brian and my
nephews, Charlie and Louie, who have been welcome additions to our family.
